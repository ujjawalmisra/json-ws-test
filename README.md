## Description

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is being heavily used in various projects, systems and platforms as the response format of **web-services**. The web-services may, themselves, be RESTful or using HTTP Methods like GET or POST for making a call, i.e. for passing inputs. 

Developers end-up writing and saving curl calls for testing these web-services as and when they develop or change them. This is really ugly and cumbersome (to keep modifying these 'saved' curl calls for repetitive testing) !! Plus such a mechanism disallows using these curl calls to be seamlessly integrated in a Test-Suite or a Nightly-Build Test System, etc.

**json-ws-test** is simple framework for testing **JSON (response) Web-Services**.
